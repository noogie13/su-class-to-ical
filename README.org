* how it works:

Clone this repo:
: git clone https://github.com/noogie13/su-class-to-ical

1. Sign into myslice
2. "View My Class Schedule"
3. "Printer Friendly Page"
4. Copy it all (Ctrl+A -> Ctrl+C)
5. Put that in a with anyname, we'll call it =input= in the directory of the script.
6. Run the script with the name of the file as a parameter =./script.py input=

Then it generates your ICS file with name schedule.ics.

Import to wherever. (Make a new calendar wherever you import it in case it it messed up).
